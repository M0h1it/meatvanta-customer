      question: "How fresh is the meat?",

    },
    {
      question: "When will my order arrive?",

      answer: chargeAnswer,
    },
    {
      question: "How do I pay?",
      answer:
        "Cash on delivery, or UPI. If you pay by UPI you'll see our UPI ID at checkout — pay from any app, then paste the receipt or enter the UTR number. We confirm the payment before preparing your order.",
    },
    {
      question: "Why does my UPI order say 'payment under review'?",
      answer:
        "We check every UPI payment by hand against our own account before starting the order. It's usually quick. Once confirmed, your order moves to preparing and the status updates automatically.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I change or cancel my order?",
      answer: `Call us as soon as possible${
        shopInfo?.phone ? ` on ${shopInfo.phone}` : ""
      }. Since everything is cut fresh to order, we can usually help if the meat hasn't been prepared yet.`,
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need an account?",
      answer:
        "You can browse and build your cart freely. Signing in with your mobile number is only needed at checkout — it takes one OTP, and it's what lets you track orders and reorder later.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I track my order?",
      answer:
        "Open My Orders and tap the order. The status updates on its own as we prepare and dispatch it — no need to refresh.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is the meat halal?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Everything is sourced and prepared to halal standards, the same way it has been for decades.",
